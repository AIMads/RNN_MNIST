# RNN_MNIST
98% accuracy on the mnist dataset, experiment with sequences and the power of them, here looking at short-term memory RNN
This model expirements with the power of recurrent neural networks also called RNN. RNN networks can look at short sequences and find
patterns, the way RNN's does that is by taking the hidden state from the previous layer in the model and using it on the next layer in the model
This is what makes it possible to give it a short term memory. which is perfect for a picture like these handwritten numbers where there aren't many pixels
For this model tensorflow 1.8 has been used and python 3.6
